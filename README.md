Machine Learning to predict the price of diamonds. (finance)

Members: Sarkar, Indrani; Kimm, June; Pentyala, Soujanya; Atherton, Max

1.The dataset, which I’ll be using for the diamond price prediction task with machine learning, contains data for almost 54,000 diamonds. This is a very good data set for beginners as it contains almost all the important characteristics of diamonds such as price, cut quality, carat, weight, colour, clarity, length, width, depth, etc.

2. Uses: Pandas, numpy, sklearn, pyplot.

3. Project is powered by 50K worth of different diamond data.

4. We are using non-classification machine learning by using linear regression. 

5. If the data is not linear as we have predicted we will using a decision tree to conduct machine learning. (Or Random Forest)

Steps to finish:

2. Data fetching/API integration --- TBD
3. Data analysis --- TBD
4. Building the ML model --- TBD
5. Testing --- TBD
6. Creating documentation --- TBD
7. Creating the presentation --- TBD
